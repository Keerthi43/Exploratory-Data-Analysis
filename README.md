# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
The Iris dataset consists of measurements for four features
and three species of Iris flowers.
Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), which involves
examining dimensions, data types, summary statistics, target
variable distribution, and visualizations, we gain valuable
insights and identify patterns within the dataset
